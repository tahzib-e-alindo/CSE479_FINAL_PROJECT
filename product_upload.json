  "description": "That isn't the only change from Zen 2 to Zen 3, however. Since it is a gaming-focused CPU, the move to a single eight-core core complex (CCX) design in Zen 3 gives the 5600X a leg up over the Ryzen 5 3600X. In the Ryzen 5 3600X, the processor was split between two four-core CCXs, made up of two dual-core core chiplet dies (CCDs) each, with one CCX disabled in the second CCD. Having the cores spread across two CCDs meant that there was increased travel time for any tasks that utilized all six cores at once, which, for example, games like GTA V and titles in the Civilization series are both known for. By that same note, lightly threaded titles like Counter-Strike: Global Offensive and Rainbow Six: Siege both suffered slightly on the Ryzen 5 3600X and on the follow-up refresh in the Zen 2 stack, due to increased latency. No more, though. Now that all the cores of the Ryzen 5 5600X have been centralized into a single CCX design, AMD's engineers have reduced the travel time between cores and decreased the latency at the same time.",

  "description": "The AMD Ryzen 9 7900X is based on the 5. generation of the AMD Ryzen 9 series which features 12 cores and 24 threads. The motherboard for the CPU has an AM5 socket. It belongs to the Ryzen 9 family and is compatible with Socket AM5 and the Zen 4 (Raphael) architecture. Simultaneous Multithreading (SMT) from AMD effectively doubles the number of cores to 24 threads. The Ryzen 9 7900X features 64MB of L3 cache and runs at 4.7 GHz by default, but depending on the workload, it can accelerate to 5.6 GHz. AMD is employing 13,140 million transistors and a 5 nm manufacturing technique to create the Ryzen 9 7900X. The TSMC foundry produces the silicon dies for the chip, not AMD. The unlocked multiplier on the Ryzen 9 7900X is fully adjustable, making it much easier to tune in any overclocking frequency. CPU Cores, Base Frequency & Internal Graphics In addition to the number of CPU cores and threads, you can see here whether the AMD Ryzen 9 7900X can be overclocked. You will also find the clock frequencies of the processor (single-core and multi-core) here. The number of CPU cores greatly affects the speed of the processor. Memory, PCIe Thermal Management The memory type as well as the amount of memory can greatly affect the speed of the processor. The memory bandwidth depends on several factors and is given in gigabytes per second. The Thermal Design Power (TDP for short) specifies the necessary cooling solution to cool the processor sufficiently. The TDP usually only gives a rough idea of the real consumption of a CPU. The AMD Ryzen 9 7900X Processor comes with a 03 years warranty (No Warranty for Fan or Cooler).",

The GPU has 16GB of GDDR6X VRAM and a 256-bit memory interface, which provides better performance and power efficiency than the previous Ampere-based iteration. The card's front panel includes several outputs, including DisplayPort 1.4a and HDMI 2.1.

The RTX 4080 is about more than simply high-resolution gaming. Computationally intensive programs can use the 9728 cores of the GPU to expedite processes using CUDA and other APIs. Gigabyte used the WINDFORCE cooling technology for cooling. The three fans rotate in opposite directions to decrease turbulence and boost airflow pressure. When the GPU is running a low-load or low-power game, the 3D Active Fan provides semi-passive cooling, and the fans turn off. The triangle fan edge splits the airflow, which is then steered smoothly along the 3D stripe curve on the fan surface. The graphene nano lubricant can improve the life of the fans while also making them quieter. It also offers RGB Fusion, which includes color customization and a range of lighting effects.
